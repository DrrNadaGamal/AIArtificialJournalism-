            <h2>About artificial intelligence and journalism, what will it be like?</h2>
            <p><h4>There is no doubt that the traditional press and the media in its different forms, especially the visual ones, stand in front of an important technological update, artificial intelligence.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>As journalists, we are at the threshold of a stage where machines will perform roles and tasks that human beings have been doing, revolutionizing the field of journalism.</h4></p>
            <h3>Journalistic writing and content formulation</h3>
            <p><h4>Looking at the progress made by AI, it can actually be predicted that this technology can contribute to the writing of the usual news materials, summaries, and reports based on data and figures, while critical and analytical journalism and reading between the lines will not be affordable for human journalists to remain preferable in this regard as they possess critical thinking skills.</h4></p>
            <h3>Verification of information and graphic materials</h3>
            <p><h4>The expansion of social media platforms and the increase in their number of users, millions of information, news, and video materials that a journalist should check before they are adopted are circulated daily. In this context, specialists talk about a fundamental role that AI will play in the process of auditing, verifying data, and detecting misinformation deliberately perpetrated by some. It has occurred, and large press institutions have fallen into fall due to insufficient verification of materials posted on the platforms or their connection through other methods, and apparently, the thing that would avoid her falling into these costly shots sometimes came.</h4></p>
            <h3>Research and data analysis</h3>
            <p><h4>AI tools and technologies are expected to assist journalists in analyzing and filtering a large number of data, statistics, and records to complete and complete reports and investigations. Not only that, but the evolution of these technologies makes us easily foresee the possibility of them linking data and identifying patterns very quickly. All of this will save journalists a lot of time and effort to invest in other respects to strengthen journalistic material since artificial intelligence has saved us from drowning in the analysis of numbers and data.</h4></p>
            <h3>Content suitable for the right audience</h3>
            <p><h4>Many are particularly excited in media departments in journalism organizations to use AI tools to identify users' trends and preferences and what they want to know more about, which will become more accessible using artificial intelligence than the tools used now. The importance of this data comes from the fact that it will facilitate the process of building and communicating content to the right user, and that this data will assist program departments in producing television programs based on public preference based on data extracted by AI.</h4></p>
            <h3>Fears</h3>
            <p><h4>Fears of AI entering the press world seem legitimate, especially as it comes at the top of these fears the prospect of these modern tools replacing the journalist threatening the disappearance of dozens of jobs from this field in favor of AI.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>On the contrary, these concerns are minimized, and AI is perceived not to replace journalism and therefore to have the potential of human beings to be linked to the ability to analyze, link, criticize, and diversify, aspects that AI cannot cover no matter how much it progresses.</h4></p>
            <p><h4>Arab, fears seem less, and talk here about the degree to which Arab press institutions are influenced by artificial intelligence tools that will not be so great as to threaten jobs. This is mainly due to the fact that Arabic is not fully supported in artificial intelligence technologies. For example, Chat GPT was the last update in 2021.</h4></p>
            <h3>The Best Now</h3>
            <p><h4>In preparation for this phase, it seems that press institutions should develop plans to train their cadres to deal with artificial intelligence technologies and tools to facilitate and accelerate work and bring touches of quality and creativity to the works produced within the institutions, especially television channels. Through these programs, the journalist will have skills to adapt to this development and drive it to achieve the goals as much as possible. This is certainly worth doing instead of sitting down and waiting for AI to sit at home.</h4></p>
